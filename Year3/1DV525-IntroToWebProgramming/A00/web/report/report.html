                    <strong>Describe your computer development environment, what OS, what terminal you are using, how
                        you are using Git (through terminal or GUI), what texteditor/IDE you work in and if you have any
                        plugins you like.</strong>
                    <p>My computer runs with Windows 10. For this assignment I only used Sublime Text to change the HTML
                        code. To be able to use Git I have GitBash installed and I then use the GitBash terminal to be
                        able to push or pull things. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub/GitLab and/or Markdown?</strong>
                    <p>Before this course I was familiar with Git and Gitlab. I used them almost for every course to be
                        able to keep a trace of what I have done. However, I have never used Markdown before </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Have you ever created websites before?</strong>
                    <p>I have participated in three web development porjects so far. Two of these projects was in group
                        and one a personal project. One website was recreating an online shop </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</strong>
                    <p>I have helped to code 3 websites in total. I mostly learned web development through a project
                        course that was taken the first year of this diploma. There I have learned how to create website
                        using Angular and how to link it with services such as Firebase database service. With this
                        knowledge I am currently creating a website to show cooking recipes or events.</p>
                </li>

                    <strong>What is your TIL for this course part?</strong>
                    <p>My TIL for this assingment so far is the Markdown that I have never used before. </p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Did you know and had used HTML and CSS before this assignment?</strong>
                    <p>Before this assignment I have already used HTML & CSS. I have used them in projects from the
                        school and for a personal project</p>
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Brifly exaplain, with your own words, about HTML to a person who have never heard of it
                        before.</strong>
                    <p><dfn title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</dfn> is a programing language used in Web
                        development. It can be considered as the skeleton of
                        the website. It is used to create a first layout of the website, to place the elements. For
                        example, where to put a button for the user to click.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Brifly exaplain, with your own words, about CSS to a person who have never heard of it
                        before.</strong>
                    <p><dfn title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</dfn> is style sheet language. It is used to add style to
                        a website. It works in cohesion with the HTML part. It can be considered as the muscle, skin of
                        our website which is the appearance. With this language developpers can change colors, center
                        text, change fonts, add spacings...</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Elaborate on the importance of keeping HTML (markup and content) and CSS (style and layout)
                        as two separate items. Is it important and in that case why? Can it be completely separated or
                        do they smoehow depend on eachother?</strong>
                    <p>It is very important to seperate the HTML and CSS part. It allows developpers to change the style
                        of website without having to create the basic layout. This procedure allows to save a lot of
                        time when changing the design of website. I do not know if it can be completly separated but I
                        know that depend on each other as you have to target specific bloc of code to add style to them
                        only. And to do this in the HTML code we need to use the "class" to identify it.

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>What is your first impression of JavaScript as a programming language?</strong>
                    <p>It is very easy to use and easy to learn but at first glance it seems to be a bit limited.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Can you compare JavaScript as a programming language with other languages you know. Do you
                        see equalities and differences?</strong>
                    <p>I find Javascript to be bit easier to use than Java. It needs less elements when creating
                        methods, variables,... .
                        In JS, there is no need to specify the type of variables or of which type the method is going to
                        return. JS is also very similar to Java in the syntax of the code.
                        <br>
                        This is the similarities and differences I have found so far while doing this course.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>What is your opinion about the popularity of JavaScript? Can you see why it became popular
                        or do you think that its popularity is overestimated? In your humble opinion?</strong>
                    <p>I think it was bound to happen. As web developement is becoming such an important part of our
                        society. The web is now omnipresent in our daily lives. This is what made JS famous, it is
                        because it is the main programming language for web applications. I think it is also the fact
                        that it is easy and fast to use without having to follow crazy syntaxes.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Describe how you opted to organise your JavaScript code in the assignment.</strong>
                    <p>I decided to create 2 main functions for the 2 "games" of the page for Javascript. I also created
                        a separate function to check if the word contains a vowel! </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>What is your TIL for this course part?</strong>
                    <p>I think the thing I learned with this course part is to make a website mobile responsive. It is
                        something that I never did before and was a bit tricky for me to adjust and to make it work.

            <h2>Part 02 - A02</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Explain how the scope works in JavaScript, how hoisting affects it and how a closure
                        works.</strong>
                    <p>The scope in JS is very similar to how the scope in Java works. For example, if the a variable is
                        initialised inside of a If statement, the value of that variable will only be accessible inside
                        this If statement and will throw Reference error if it is being called outside! For hoisting,
                        all the functions or variables will be declared at the top of their scope. So if a variable is
                        declared outside all the functions it will become global variables and will be available to use
                        everywhere in the code! For Closures it is when two functions are bundled together where the
                        inner function has access to the scope of the outer function. They are often used for object
                        data privacy or event handlers. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>What are your thoughs on the module design pattern and the prototype object model?</strong>
                    <p>I was struggling a bit at the beginning to understand how everything in the module design pattern
                        was supposed to work. But as soon as I undertstood it, i found it easy to write functions and
                        easy to call them. It reminded me of how Java works with custom classes. And for prototype
                        object model, I have only checked what it was but have not used it so I cannot give my
                        comprehensive review on it yet! </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Describe how you opted to organise your JavaScript code in the assignment and your
                        observations and learnings from your code structure.</strong>
                    <p>For the Hangman game, I have used the module design pattern. For the Quizz, I have opted to use
                        the ES Module. I have realised that the ES Module was similar to what I was using when coding
                        website with Angular. I still had difficulties to get back variables from the modules to the
                        main JavaScript file. But it also made me realised that having a good structure when coding is
                        almost the most important. It helps to have a clear view of how the whole system works and
                        prevent from getting lost with a single JS file of 500 lines. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>How do you feel about asynchronous programming in JavaScript, can you relate it to some
                        other programming you done previously?</strong>
                    <p>I think that asynchronous programming is very important in web developement. I have used a bunch
                        of times previously when I was working on website with Angular and Firebase. It is a bit tricky
                        to get how it works exactly but it appears to very usefull in many situations. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Elaborate on the lint (test) and build sequence of your code. Do you see pros and cons and
                        can you relate it other development work you have done?</strong>
                    <p>I did not know about those kind of tools that could be used within web development. I have used
                        the html-lint in this project to be able to check if my HTML files were well written. And by
                        only using the command <code>npm run test</code>. I was able to check for human errors that I
                        would probably miss when looking at my code. Right now, as I only started to use linters I do
                        not see any cons at the moment. <br> For minifiers, I have decided to use html-minifier and
                        again I did not know such tools existed. I have realised that minifiers are very important in
                        web devlopment as most people look at website on their phone now. Therefore it is very important
                        to minify website before uploading them to the web. It also helps people leaving in remote areas
                        or with bad internet connection to still access a website faster. I really do not see any cons
                        for minifiers yet as I have not work with them too much so far.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>What is your TIL for this course part?</strong>
                    <p>My biggest TIL for this assignment was probably learning about linters and minifiers. I do not
                        the concept of those too before starting this assigment. And it made me realise that they are
                        really needed to make websites faster and a step closer towards zero errors! </p>

            <h2>Part 03 - A03</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>For each feature (F1, F2 and so on) you have implemented, write a 5-10 sentences text about
                        it and let the teacher know how you solved it. This is essential. There is no grade if you fail
                        to write about the features.</strong>
                    <p><strong>F1:</strong> To be able to do a single page application, I have used ES6 Modules. For
                        dragging the windows
                        I have used EventListeners onmousedown, onmouseup and onmousemove. It allowed me to track where
                        the user is dragging the window and therefore allows me to change the position of the window
                        inside the PWD. To be able to solve the focus, I have just created a global variable everytime
                        there is a click on the window I increment this number and sets the "zIndex" of this div which
                        makes it get the focus. </p>
                    <p><strong>F2:</strong> For this assignment I only have around 20 commits. I always struggle to
                        remember to commits everytime I finish a functionality. I have used JSDoc for every function and
                        constructors of the code. For the ES modules, I have organised my code into 4 modules. One for
                        the controller "app.js", one for the chat, one for the Memory Game and one for the Weather
                        module. Concerning the npm test, I have fixed all the errors that test were telling me. </p>
                    <p><strong>F3:</strong> For the MemoryGame, I have decided to first show a menu t o be able to
                        select which size of the game they want to use. To be able to choose the order of the picture I
                        create an array filled with numbers where each number appears twice. Then I shuffle this array
                        using the Fisher-Yates algorithm. The numbers represents the images name and this how i
                        randomise them. To be able to show them on screen I use row and columns depending on the size. I
                        store the image in the div value and whenever someone click on the div I will add the image to
                        the div which will make it appear on screen. </p>
                    <p><strong>F4:</strong> For the Chat Application, the first time the user will open the app it will
                        ask for an username. This username will be stored on the localStorage so that everytime he open
                        the chat App again. The user will be already connected with this username. I use a webSocket to
                        be able to connect to the server. I am using EventListeners such as onerror, onopen and
                        onmessage to be able to show the messages on the screen as soon as they arrived or show it on
                        the screen the user is connected. The user can also see at least 20 messages before the
                        scrollbars appear. </p>
                    <p><strong>F5:</strong> For the Weather Application, I have used an API from openweathermap.org. It
                        allowed me to fetch data depending on which city the user want to see. After sending the fetch
                        request I received a JSON file back with a lot of weather information. I then only select the
                        information I thought was important and put it on the window as content. And if the suer writes
                        down a not existing location the API will let me know and I can tell the user that the city was
                        not found or does not exists according to the API. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Write a concluding text, 5-10 sentences, about your implementation of the project. Write
                        about hard/easy, troubles/solutions, and so on, things you encountered and thought of during the
                        project and its implementation.</strong>
                    <p>I really liked to implement this website, because so far I only knew how to code website using
                        Angular and it is way more complicated then with ES6 modules. I found this project to be rather
                        easy but it takes a huge amount of times to find the correct tags or to try to make the website
                        look nice. I really liked learning how chat works, now I finally understand how they work and
                        can recreate them for future projects. I also liked to work with API, I never did it before
                        because I always thought it was something hard to do. </p>

                    <p>My TIL for this part will be working with APIs and the chat implementation. I have learned how to
                        do both during this assignment and now I feel more confident to do them again later on future
                        projects. </p>

                        a scale 1-10 where 10 is "quite good course" and 1 is "not so good".</strong>
                    <p>I really like this course because I learned a new way and lot of things about how everything
                        works. Also I liked the fact that for each assignment we had very different tasks which made me
                        learn about a lot of things. If I could change something about this course would be when it is
                        in the program. I feel like this course should have been tought to us on the 1st year of the
                        Bachelor. As we already had 2 advanced projects before without learning the basics first. On a
                        scale 1-10, I would rate this course an 8!</p>

                    <strong>What is your overall TIL for this course?</strong>
                    <p>My overall TIL for this course would be to learn how to code a website without using Angular.
                        Also I have learned how to use APIs which is something I wanted to do for a while but never got
                        the motivation to do!</p>
